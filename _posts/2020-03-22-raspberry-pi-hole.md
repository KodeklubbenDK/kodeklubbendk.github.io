## Pi-hole
Pi-holeÂ© is a DNS sinkhole which protects mobile devices and laptops from unwanted content in apps and on webpages. It does not require any client-side software to run on your mobile device or laptop which indeed makes it pretty nice!

In other words Pi-hole is a modern adblocker at DNS level. It is a free and open source project and thereby it makes you the sole person in charge of your own privacy. Pi-hole comes with an easy to use and responsive web interface, from where it is possible to whitelist or blacklist domains that serves you with ads.

Pi-hole can't protect you from all ads since some adservices are dynamic or ads have been embedded directly into content. But overall it would protect against a lot of ads.

## Prerequisites
The only thing you will need in order to implement a pi-hole is a Raspberry Pi. Throughout this post i will be using a Raspberry Pi Zero W (version 1.1) from 2017.

If you have no experience using a Raspberry Pi or need to freshen it up - consider reading my post about [Getting started with Raspberry Pi Zero W.]({% post_url 2020-03-22-customizing-bash-terminal %}) <!-- LINK TO ANOTHER POST -->

## Installation
Before following this guide on how to install i would recommend you to take a look at the [offical documentation][pi-hole-docs]. This would be rather helpful in case of my guide being outdated.

### Upgrade Packages
I recommend you to start by upgrading your packages with the following command.

{% highlight bash %}
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
{% endhighlight %}

### Methods
It is possible to install Pi-hole by 3 different methods eg. one step automated, cloning the repository or by an installer. I used the one step automated install for easiness but it has a major downside.

{% highlight bash %}
curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash
{% endhighlight %}

Piping to bash is a controversial topic, as it prevents you from reading code that is about to run on your system which is the major downside by this installation method.
