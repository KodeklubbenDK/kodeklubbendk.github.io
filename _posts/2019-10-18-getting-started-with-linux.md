Youâ€™ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
puts "Hello World!"
puts "Hello World!"
puts "Hello World!"
puts "Hello World!"
{% endhighlight %}
